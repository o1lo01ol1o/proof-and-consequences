## Getting started
You should be able to follow the [plfa getting started section for Emacs](https://plfa.github.io/GettingStarted/) and then

```bash
git clone https://github.com/o1lo01ol1o/proof-and-consequences.git
cd proof-and-consequences && emacs .
```

You can check that `agda-mode` is functioning by opening `src/Foo.agda` and then loading the module into `agda-mode`.  Agda will then expose a "hole" for the definition of doublenegation and you can begin interative thoerm proving.
